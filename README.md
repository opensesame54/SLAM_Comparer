# SLAM Comparer

A tool for comparing visual SLAM (vSLAM) results generated by different pipelines — specifically, **ORB‑SLAM3** and a **SIFT‑based SLAM** variant. This project helps evaluate and visualize trajectory and map differences between the two systems.

---

## Overview

**SLAM Comparer** provides an environment to run and compare SLAM outputs using datasets such as the **TUM RGB‑D benchmark**. It relies on the following dependencies for SLAM execution and visualization:

* [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3)
* [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin)

---

## Dependencies

Before using this project, make sure you have the following installed:

* CMake ≥ 3.10
* GCC/G++ ≥ 9.0
* OpenCV ≥ 4.0
* Eigen ≥ 3.3
* Pangolin
* ORB-SLAM3

---

## Setup Instructions

Clone the required repositories and build them as follows:

```bash
# Clone required repositories
git clone https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3.git
git clone https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
```

### Build ORB-SLAM3

```bash
cd ORB_SLAM3
./build.sh
```

### Build Pangolin

```bash
cd ../Pangolin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## Running ORB-SLAM3 on a TUM RGB-D Dataset

You can run ORB-SLAM3 on a sample RGB‑D sequence from the TUM dataset using the following command (adjust paths as needed):

```bash
./ORB_SLAM3/Examples/RGB-D/rgbd_tum \
    ./ORB_SLAM3/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt \
    ./ORB_SLAM3/Examples/RGB-D/TUM1.yaml \
    /path/to/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_room/ \
    /path/to/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_room/associations.txt
```

Make sure to replace the dataset path and the configuration file (`TUM1.yaml`) for your sequence.

## Running SIFT‑based SLAM

> Provide instructions here specific to your SIFT‑SLAM implementation (build steps, dependencies, and the command to run it). Keep the dataset and association files identical to ORB‑SLAM3 for fair comparison.

---

## Results Comparison

This section is a template for how to organize and present the comparison results.

### Metrics (suggested)

* **Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE)** — overall trajectory alignment error.
* **Relative Pose Error (RPE)** — short‑term drift statistics.
* **RMSE** — root mean squared error for translation and rotation components.
* **Track length / number of keyframes** — to show how much of the sequence was successfully tracked.

### Example layout (placeholders)

* `results/orb/trajectory.txt` — ORB‑SLAM3 estimated poses
* `results/sift/trajectory.txt` — SIFT‑SLAM estimated poses
* `plots/trajectory_comparison.png` — 2D/3D overlay of trajectories
* `plots/ate_rpe_table.md` — a small table summarizing ATE / RPE / RMSE

### Recommended tools

* [evo](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo) — for computing ATE and RPE from trajectory files.
* matplotlib / Pangolin — for plotting trajectories and maps.

---

## Example: compute ATE with evo

```bash
# assuming both trajectories are in TUM pose format
evo_ape tum results/orb/trajectory.txt results/sift/trajectory.txt -r full --plot --save_plot plots/trajectory_comparison.png
```

---

## Notes

* Ensure both SLAM systems use the same dataset, camera calibration, and initial conditions for a fair comparison.
* If timestamps or association files differ, align them before comparison.
* For reproducibility, record the commit hashes of ORB‑SLAM3 and your SIFT‑SLAM implementation.
